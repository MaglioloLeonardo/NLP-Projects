# NLP-Projects
Collection of various Natural Language Processing projects involving:
-Chatbot programming with Natural Language Generation
-Document classification using Vector Space Model implementation(Supervised Machine Learning)
-Text Segmentation using a programmed implementation of TextTiling(Unsupervided Machine Learning)
-Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Gensim(Unsupervised Machine Learning).

For every subject related to machine learning was conducted a study of the algorithms for a choosen dataset, the work is present as pdf in the directory associated for each project.
