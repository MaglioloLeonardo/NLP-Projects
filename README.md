# NLP-Projects
Collection of various Natural Language Processing projects involving:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Chatbot programming with Natural Language Generation</li>
  <li>Document classification using Vector Space Model implementation(Supervised Machine Learning)</li>
  <li>Segmentation using a programmed implementation of TextTiling(Unsupervided Machine Learning)</li>
  <li>Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Gensim(Unsupervised Machine Learning)</li>
</ul>
<br>
For every subject related to machine learning was conducted a study of the algorithms for a choosen dataset, the work is present as pdf in the directory associated for each project.
